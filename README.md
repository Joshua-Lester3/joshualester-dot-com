Repo for my personal website. You can find it at [joshualester.com](https://www.joshualester.com). 

It's built in Nuxt with Nuxt Content to allow for a possible blog later. I registered the domain with AWS and registered the public certificate to use HTTPS with AWS ACM. The static files are stored in AWS S3 and Static Site Hosting is enabled. CloudFront is connected to the static site endpoint and Route 53 is connected to CloudFront.
